# Analyzing_Music_Data-SQL-Python-
The purpose of this project is to analyze data from Spotify &amp; the Billboard Top 100 charts in order to observe any similarities between the two data sets. Are people still listening (on Spotify) to the songs that were popular in years past? What variables/characteristics are most common among the music being listened to today? Any interesting trends?
